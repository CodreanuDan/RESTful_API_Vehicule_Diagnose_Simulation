# RESTful API for Vehicle Diagnosis Simulation

## Overview
This project models a vehicle diagnosis API that interacts with a virtual ECU (Electronic Control Unit) implemented in Python. The API allows control over engine parameters, communication, security management, power supply, and error injection. Built with Flask-RESTful, it supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

A LabVIEW client interface has been developed for real-time testing and visualization.

## API Features
- **Engine Parameters** – Read and modify engine performance metrics.
- **Communication** – Simulate vehicle communication protocols.
- **Security Management** – Implement authentication and access control mechanisms.
- **Power Supply** – Monitor and adjust voltage levels.
- **Error Injection** – Simulate and test error-handling mechanisms.

## LabVIEW Client
The LabVIEW client provides an interactive front-end for testing the API:
